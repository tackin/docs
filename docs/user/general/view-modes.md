# Change file list views in OpenCloud

<br/><br/>

## In OpenCloud you can choose between different **view modes** for your files and folders to customize the display according to your preferences

<br/><br/>

---

### Available view modes

#### **Default table view**

→ The classic **List view**, in which all files and folders are displayed in a detailed table.
<img src={require("./img/view-modes/default.png").default} alt="Default" width="1920"/>
<br/><br/>

#### **Condensed table view**

→ A more compact version of the **table view**, in which the data is summarized more closely to save space.
<img src={require("./img/view-modes/condensed.png").default} alt="Condensed" width="1920"/>
<br/><br/>

#### **Tiles view**

→ A view in which files and folders are displayed as **tiles**. Ideal for **visual representations** and if you want to access **icons** quickly.
<img src={require("./img/view-modes/tiles.png").default} alt="Tiles" width="1920"/>
<br/><br/>

With these options, you can **flexibly customize** your **Fileslist view** to choose the best display for you!
