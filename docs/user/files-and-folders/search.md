### This is how the search works:

    - The **search bar** is located at the top of the **top bar** in the **web interface**.
<img src={require("./img/search/searchbar.png").default} alt="search bar" width="1920"/>
<br/><br/>

- Select search area:
    - Click on the **drop-down menu** next to the **search bar**.
    - Select whether you want to search in all files or only in the current folder.
<img src={require("./img/search/drop-down-menu-searchbar.png").default} alt="select where to search" width="500"/>
<br/><br/>
- Search function:
    -The **searches** through file names as well as the content of the files to **display relevant results**.
<img src={require("./img/search/search-example.png").default} alt="example search" width="500"/>
<br/><br/>
