# Search

## Using the search in OpenCloud

You can use the search bar in the top bar to find files and content quickly.

### This is how the search works

- Find search bar - The **search bar** is located at the top of the **top bar** in the **web interface**.
  <img src={require("./img/search/searchbar.png").default} alt="search bar" width="1920"/>

- Select search area - Click on the **drop-down menu** next to the **search bar**. - Select whether you want to search in all files or only in the current folder.
  <img src={require("./img/search/drop-down-menu-searchbar.png").default} alt="select where to search" width="500"/>
- Search function - This **searches** through file names as well as the content of the files to **display relevant results**.
  <img src={require("./img/search/search-example.png").default} alt="example search" width="500"/>

  Use these steps to find your files or folders quickly and efficiently!
