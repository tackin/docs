# 📁 Best Practices for Organizing Spaces in OpenCloud

Spaces are collaborative areas meant to be used by multiple users. Unlike personal storage, they must be structured in a way that supports clarity, collaboration, and scalability. This guide helps you set up and maintain well-organized, long-term usable Spaces.

---

## ✅ General Principles

- **Plan first** – Don't treat Spaces like ad-hoc storage. Think ahead.
- **Think in roles and teams** – Structure based on how people work together.
- **Keep it scalable** – Choose a structure that works now *and* with more users later.
- **Apply consistency** – Naming, access, and structure should follow shared rules.

## 📂 Folder Structure: Recommended Patterns

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Example: Family

```
📁 Family Space
 ├── 📂 Documents
 │    ├── 🧾 Insurance
 │    └── 📑 Contracts
 ├── 📂 Photos
 │    ├── 📸 2024
 │    └── 📸 2023
 └── 📂 Shared Notes
```

### 🏫 School / Kindergarten

```
📁 Class 3B 2024
 ├── 📂 Teaching Materials
 ├── 📂 Parent Communication
 ├── 📂 Homework Submissions
 └── 📂 Events & Photos
```

### 🏢 Company / Team

```
📁 Marketing Team
 ├── 📂 Campaigns
 │    ├── 📂 Q1-2025
 │    └── 📂 Q2-2025
 ├── 📂 Templates
 ├── 📂 Reports
 └── 📂 Meeting Notes
```

---

## 🧾 Naming Conventions

- Use **clear, descriptive names** – avoid "new folder" or cryptic titles
- Prefer **lowercase-with-dashes** or **Title Case**
- Add dates when relevant: `report-2025-Q2.pdf` or `Budget 2024.xlsx`
- Avoid special characters: `& % $ § !` may break integrations

---

## 👥 Ownership & Access Guidelines

- Assign **Space Owners**: Responsible for structure and permissions
- Use **Groups** where possible for access control (e.g. `staff`, `students`, `parents`)
- Keep sensitive content in **separate folders** with restricted access
- Define **editing vs. viewing** rights clearly

---

## 📦 Archiving & Clean-Up

- Set up an **archive folder** for old or unused files
- Annually review the Space and remove outdated content
- Use versioning or export before deletion if unsure

## ❌ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| ❌ Don’t                         | ✅ Instead                        |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Dump all files in root folder   | Use clear subfolders             |
| Mix personal and shared content | Keep personal data in "My Files" |
| Give all users full access      | Apply least-privilege principle  |
| Use inconsistent naming         | Define and follow conventions    |

---

## 📄 Shareable Quick Start Template

You can use this as a template for new Spaces:

```
📁 [Team/Project Name]
 ├── 📂 Documents
 ├── 📂 Planning
 ├── 📂 Resources
 ├── 📂 Archive
 └── README.md (Space purpose, structure, rules)
```

---

## 🎯 Summary

| Goal                         | How                                |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Make Spaces easy to navigate | Use clear folder names & hierarchy |
| Avoid permission chaos       | Define ownership and roles         |
| Keep things clean            | Review regularly and archive       |
| Support collaboration        | Use group access & standard naming |
