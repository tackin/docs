### Add a member

- **Open Space**  
   - Go to your Space and open the members menu.

<br/><br/>
- **Search for a member:**  
   - In the members menu, you can search for the user from your organization that you want to add.
   <img src={require("./img/add-user/search-user.png").default} alt="search user" width="400"/>       
<br/><br/>
- **Assign rights:**  
   - Select the desired rights for the member, e.g. whether the person may only read or also edit.
   <img src={require("./img/add-user/choose-rights.png").default} alt="Choose rights" width="400"/>    
<br/><br/>
- **Add:**  
   - Click on “Add” to invite the member to the Space.
   <img src={require("./img/add-user/member-added.png").default} alt="Member added" width="400"/> 
<br/><br/>
- **Change rights:** 
   - To change the rights of a member, open the members menu, click on the corresponding user and select the desired new rights.
   <img src={require("./img/add-user/change-rights.png").default} alt="Change rights" width="400"/> 
<br/><br/>
- **Remove members:** 
   - Open the members menu, click on the three-dot menu next to the member you want to remove and select “Remove member”.
   <img src={require("./img/add-user/remove-user.png").default} alt="Remove user" width="400"/>
<br/><br/>
**The removed member immediately loses access to the space.**

### Important notes

- The added member has immediate access to the Space.
- **Attention:** Every user with the “can manage” right has the authorization to deactivate and delete the Space.
- A deleted Space **cannot be restored**, so be careful who you grant these rights to.
