## 🔑 App Tokens

App Tokens allow you to connect external apps and services (such as WebDAV clients) securely without using your main password.

---

### ✅ How to Create an App Token

1. Go to the **App Tokens** section in your OpenCloud account settings.
2. Click on **“+ New”** to create a new token.
3. Enter a **name** for the token (e.g., "WebDAV Client").
4. Select an **expiration date** for added security.
5. Click **Create**.

### 📋 Copy the Token

- Once the token is created, it will be shown **only once**.
- **Copy it immediately** and store it in a secure place.

> ⚠️ If you lose the token, you’ll need to delete it and create a new one.

### 🔧 Use the Token

You can now use the token in place of your password when connecting:

- WebDAV
- External apps
- Third-party services

---

### 🗑️ Delete a Token

If a token is no longer needed:

1. Go back to the **App Tokens** section.
2. Click the **trash icon** next to the token to remove it.

This ensures unused tokens cannot be misused.
