In a Space, members can have different roles that give them different levels of access.

### Can View

This role allows the member to view and download files in the Space, but they cannot make any changes, upload or create new files and folders.

### Can Edit

With this role, the member can do everything a "Can View" member can do, plus:

- Upload files to the Space
- Create new files and folders
- Delete files and folders, including their history
- Restore deleted files

### Can Manage

This role gives the member all the abilities of "Can Edit," plus:

- Add or remove members from the Space
- Change the roles of other members in the Space
- Enable and disable the Space
- Edit the quota of the Space
- Delete the Space

**Each role determines what a member can do within the Space!**
