# Using Multiple Accounts in OpenCloud Desktop

You can synchronize multiple accounts from different OpenCloud servers to your local machine. This allows you to manage files from different instances within the same desktop client.

## How to Add a New Account

1. Open **OpenCloud Desktop**
2. Click on **Add Account**

3. Follow the [standard setup process](./set-up):
   - Enter the server URL
   - Log in with your credentials
   - Authorize access

## Switching Between Accounts

- After adding multiple accounts, they will appear in the **account overview** in the settings menu
- You can easily switch between them to manage synchronization settings for each account separately

## How Files are Stored Locally

- In your **File Explorer**, each account will have a separate folder
- By default, the folders are named:
  - **OpenCloud** (for the first account)
  - **OpenCloud (2)** (for the second account)
  - **OpenCloud (3)** (for the third account), and so on

This setup ensures that files from different accounts remain **organized and do not mix**.
