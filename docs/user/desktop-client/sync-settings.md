### Show in Explorer or Finder
- Opens the selected Space directly in your **File Explorer (Windows)** or **Finder (Mac)**

### Show in Web Browser
- Opens the Space in your **web browser**
- If you're not logged in, you may need to **sign in first**

### Force Sync Now
- Manually forces an **immediate synchronization** of the Space
- Useful if you want to ensure all changes are uploaded/downloaded right away

### Pause Sync
- Temporarily **stops synchronization** for the Space
- Can be resumed anytime by selecting **Resume Sync**

### Remove Sync Folder Connection
- Stops syncing the Space, but **does not delete local files** 
- The Space remains on the server, and you can add it again later

### Choose What to Sync
- Opens a window where you can **select specific folders** from the Space to sync
- Helps **save storage space** by syncing only necessary files

**Note:** Files and folders that are not synced will **no longer be available** on your local machine.

### **Tip**  
Adjusting these settings allows you to **optimize storage space and network usage**, ensuring only the files you need are kept in sync.
