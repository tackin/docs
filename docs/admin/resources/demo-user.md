# **Demo User Overview**

This page introduces the pre-configured demo users available in OpenCloud. These users are designed to help you explore the platformâ€™s features, test different roles, and experience OpenCloud from various perspectives without setting up new accounts.

Each demo user has specific permissions and access levels, allowing you to simulate real-world scenarios such as **admin management, file sharing, and collaboration**.

Below, youâ€™ll find details about each user, including their roles and login credentials.
