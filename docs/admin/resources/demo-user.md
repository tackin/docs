# **Demo User Overview**

This page introduces the pre-configured demo users available in OpenCloud. These users are designed to help you explore the platform’s features, test different roles, and experience OpenCloud from various perspectives without setting up new accounts.

Each demo user has specific permissions and access levels, allowing you to simulate real-world scenarios such as **admin management, file sharing, and collaboration**.

Below, you’ll find details about each user, including their roles and login credentials.
