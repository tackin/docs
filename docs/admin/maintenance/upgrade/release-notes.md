# ðŸ“¦ Release Notes: Migration from v2.x.x to v3.0.0

- Version: 3.0.0
- Type: Major Release (Breaking Changes in the GraphAPI)
- [Details Â· Download](https://github.com/opencloud-eu/opencloud/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

---

## Who Is Affected?

This release introduces a **breaking change in the GraphAPI**.  
If you are using OpenCloud only through official clients (Web, Desktop, or Mobile), **no migration is needed**.

If you're using any other software that utilizes the GraphAPI, that software might need to be adjusted to follow the new behavior of the GraphAPI.

---

## Key Changes

The following endpoints of the GraphAPI were changed in a way that is not backwards compatible with the previous releases:

```http
GET /v1.0/me/drives/
GET /v1.0/drives/
GET /v1beta1/drives/
GET /v1beta1/me/drives/
```

Due to performance optimizations, these endpoints no longer automatically expand all permissions on the drives root items. If needed, the permissions can be explicitly requested via the appropriate $expand query option.
