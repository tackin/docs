Administrators have the ability to provide additional web applications to their users. This feature is especially useful for organizations that want to integrate third-party tools or provide internally developed apps within the OpenCloud environment.

## 🚀 Installing a Web Application

You can install a web application in just a few steps:

### 1. Open the App Store

Use the **Application Switcher** in the top navigation bar of OpenCloud and navigate to the **App Store**.

<img src={require("./img/app-store.png").default} alt="App Store" width="1920"/>

### 2. Download the Application

Find and download the application you want to install.

### 3. Extract and copy

Unzip the downloaded archive and copy the extracted folder into the web application directory.  
By default, this path is:

```bash
opencloud/services/web/assets/apps
```

### 4. Access in OpenCloud

Once the app is copied to the correct location, it will automatically appear in the OpenCloud interface.

## ⚙️ Configure a Web Application

Some OpenCloud apps require additional configuration — for example, the **External Sites** app.

These configurations can be managed in the following file:

```bash
opencloud/deployments/examples/opencloud_full/config/opencloud/apps.yaml
```

📘 Note: Configuration details vary between apps.
For specific setup instructions, please refer to the official documentation of the respective app.
